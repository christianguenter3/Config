*Project Description*
An AutoHotkey (AHK) script that allows you to easily call AHK functions to run other AHK scripts. (Requires AutoHotkey_L).

Instead of having to remember what hotkey maps to each of your AHK scripts (as you could have hundreds), this displays a list of Commands in a light-weight GUI that allows you to quickly and easily run your scripts.  Simply type part of the command name and hit enter to run your script.  You can also provide parameters to your commands, allowing you to change the functionality of a command with a few keystrokes.

For more reasons to use this with your AHK scripts, see [Why Use AHK Command Picker].

*How To Use AHK Command Picker*
To launch AHK Command Picker run the _AHKCommandPicker.ahk_ script.

Press the Caps Lock key to bring up the AHK Command Picker GUI.  From there just type the name of the command that you want to run and hit enter to run it.  You can still toggle Caps Lock on and off by pressing Shift+Caps Lock.

To add your own commands to AHK Command Picker, see the [url:documentation|http://ahkcommandpicker.codeplex.com/documentation].
