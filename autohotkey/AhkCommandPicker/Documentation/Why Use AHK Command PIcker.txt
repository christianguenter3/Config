AutoHotkey is such a powerful language and can be used to do so many things.  Because of this you will likely have many AHK scripts/hotkeys to accomplish a variety of different tasks, some that you use frequently and others not so frequently.

AHK Command Picker solves the following problems:
* Trying to remember which hotkeys (i.e. key combinations) are used to launch which scripts (e.g. which script does Win+A launch again?).
* Trying to find new hotkeys that aren't already used by other applicaitons (e.g. I hit Ctrl+N to open a new tab in my application, but it launched one of my scripts as well. Oops).
* Accidentally launching scripts by unintentionally hitting a hotkey key combination (e.g. my fingers weren't on home-row as I thought they were, or my son came over and mashed a bunch of keys).

I've found that by not having to find and assign a specific hotkey (i.e. keyboard combination) to each of my scripts, I am more likely to automate many more of my tasks.  Before I would worry about having to remember too many keyboard shortcuts and the overhead involved (remembering which shortcut launches what, accidentally triggering them, etc), so I would only use AHK to automate the tasks that I did all of the time.  Now with AHK Command Picker these problems are gone, so I automate everything; even the tasks that I might only do once a month.

Also, because AHK Command Picker allows parameters to be passed to the Commands, scripts can easily be created or slightly modified to be more generic and support doing much more with them.  For example, AHK Command Picker comes with a "Web Browser" command that opens the default web browser.  By passing it parameters you can also do a Google search for the parameters passed in.  For example, typing "Web Browser, cats, dogs" will open the default browser if it's not already open, and open up two tabs, where one does a Google search for "cats" and the other one for "dogs".
